# Dotfiles

These are my config files, some I don't use anymore but I like to keep them.

## How to use them

You have to do these commands in your home folder (also known as `~` folder)

```
git init
git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/REIS0/dotfiles.git
git pull origin main
. scripts/[linux distro]_install.sh
```

With this is expected to install everything needed, if you have any trouble just put an issue in gitlab or github.

### Attention!

Some scripts may be outdated since I have not used some distros for a long time.
